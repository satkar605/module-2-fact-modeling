  Lab 2: Fact Table Modeling â€” Merging Yesterday's Snapshot with Today's Events
  Description:
    - Extracts yesterday's snapshot from users_cumulated (2022-12-31).
    - Aggregates today's (2023-01-01) event data from the raw events table.
    - Performs a FULL OUTER JOIN to combine both datasets.
    - Prepares data for updating the fact table, determining the correct snapshot date
      for each user.
    - Accumulates dates_active array for each user based on today's activity.
    - Note: user_id column was changed from BIGINT to TEXT for better flexibility.
